- **Development Tools:** Postman, Git

## Programming Techniques Used

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Using React.js, I structured the app with reusable components, promoting clean code and modularity. This makes it easier to maintain and scale the app. <br />

- **State Management:** Leveraged Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing component states and handling side effects, like fetching player data or updating rankings. <br />

- **API Integration:** The app communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs built with Node.js and Express, allowing seamless interaction between the frontend and the PostgreSQL database. <br />

- **Responsive Web Design:** Applied SCSS with media queries to ensure that the app is responsive and provides an optimal experience across various devices, from desktop to mobile. <br />

- **Database Normalization:** Designed the PostgreSQL database schema to be normalized, minimizing redundancy and ensuring data integrity while enabling efficient queries. <br />

- **Error Handling:** Implemented robust error handling in both the frontend and backend to ensure smooth operation, including custom error messages for failed API calls and data retrieval issues. <br />

- **Async Data Fetching:** Used async/await syntax for fetching data asynchronously, improving the user experience by preventing UI blocking while loading data. <br />

- **Dynamic Search and Filtering:** Developed dynamic search and filter functionality that allows users to query data in real time, improving navigation and user interactivity. <br />
